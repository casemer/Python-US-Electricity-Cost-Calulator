# Python-US-Electricity-Cost-Calulator
Using this program, openpyxl, and the excel sheet I created, you can caluclate the cost of your average electricity for the day, week, month, and year.

if you wish to add more items to the excel file, all you have to do is add the name (and alt name) in the first two columns and it's average (or specific if you know it) wattage. hit save, and run the python script!

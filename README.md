# Python-US-Electricity-Cost-Calulator
Using this program, openpyxl, and the excel sheet I created, you can caluclate the cost of your average electricity for the day, week, month, and year.

if you wish to add more items to the excel file, all you have to do is add the name (and alt name) in the first two columns and it's average (or specific if you know it) wattage. hit save, and run the python script!

## To Use
1. Download the repo, or just the two files seperatly into a folder. 
2. open the python script (either using python IDLE or typing CMD into the file explorer search while in the folder)
3. If you are in cmd, type "python khwexcel.py" and enjoy
4. If you are in IDLE, hit F5, or select run in the top toolbar
5. Follow the instructions provided by the program.


If you have any issues, let me know! I made this because I plan on moving soon and I wanted to get a more accurate understanding on what I would be paying for.
